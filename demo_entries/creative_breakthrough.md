**Summary:**
Finally cracked the algorithm problem that's been blocking me for weeks! The solution came in a dream and I rushed to implement it.

**Core Reflections:**

- Creative blocks often resolve themselves with time and subconscious processing.
- The feeling of breakthrough is pure dopamine - I need to remember this motivation.
- Dreams can be incredible problem-solving tools if you pay attention to them.
