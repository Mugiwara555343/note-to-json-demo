**Tone:** Frustrated

**Summary:**
Spent 6 hours debugging a simple bug that turned out to be a typo. Feeling exhausted and questioning my competence.

**Core Reflections:**
- When frustrated, I make more mistakes - need to recognize this pattern.
- Sometimes stepping away is more productive than pushing through.
- Simple bugs can be the most demoralizing because they feel like they shouldn't exist.
- My self-worth shouldn't be tied to coding success or failure.
