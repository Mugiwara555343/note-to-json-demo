**Summary:**
Had an amazing brainstorming session with the team today. Everyone's ideas built on each other and we came up with something none of us would have thought of alone.

**Core Reflections:**
- Collective intelligence is real - the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
- I learn so much from seeing how others approach problems differently.
- Good collaboration requires both speaking up and listening deeply.
- The energy of a productive team meeting can carry me through the whole day.
